            From Our Home to Yours
          </h1>
          <p class="text-xl">
            Hi, I'm Paula Bryan, the founder of Southern Sense. My journey into candlemaking 
            started right here in my North Carolina kitchen, born from a desire to fill my 
            home with warm, inviting scents that felt both luxurious and safe for my family.
          </p>
          <p>
            What began as a personal passion quickly grew. I was frustrated with mass-produced 
            candles that burned unevenly, lost their scent, and were made with harsh chemicals. 
            I knew there had to be a better wayâ€”a way to combine the art of traditional 
            candlemaking with modern, clean ingredients.
          </p>
          <p>
            Southern Sense is the result of that dream. Every candle we offer is hand-poured 
            in small batches. We use a premium blend of natural soy wax, clean-burning cotton wicks, 
            and phthalate-free fragrance oils infused with essential oils. 
          </p>
          <p class="font-semibold text-charcoal">
            Our mission is simple: to create high-quality, clean-burning candles that 
            bring a sense of comfort, elegance, and southern hospitality into your home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you for supporting our small business and letting us share our passion with you.
          </p>
