        Welcome to our sustainable refill program! We're thrilled to offer a
        way to enjoy your favorite Southern Sense candles while being kind to
        the planet (and your wallet).
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-playfair font-semibold">How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        Our program is simple. You bring us your *clean* and *undamaged*
        Southern Sense candle jars, and we'll refill them with the scent of
        your choice for a discounted price.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-playfair font-semibold">Refill Pricing</h3>
      <p>
        Refills are priced based on the size of the jar. This offers you a
        significant savings compared to purchasing a new candle each time.

        Guidelines for Refills
      </h2>
      <p>
        To ensure a high-quality and safe refill, we have a few important
        guidelines:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Only Southern Sense Jars:</strong> We can only accept jars
          that were originally purchased from Southern Sense. We cannot verify
          the safety and heat resistance of other containers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clean Jars Only:</strong> Jars must be returned completely
          clean. This means all old wax, wick-tabs, and residue must be
          removed. Jars with residue will be returned to you un-filled.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Damaged Jars:</strong> We cannot refill any jars that have
          chips, cracks, or deep scratches. This is a critical safety measure,
          as damaged glass can break when heated.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wick & Scent Choice:</strong> You can choose any scent from
          our current collection for your refill, even if it's different from
          the original!
        </li>
      </ol>

        How to Clean Your Jar
      </h3>
      <p>
        The easiest way to clean your jar is to place it in the freezer for a
        few hours. The cold will cause the wax to shrink and pop out easily.
        You can then use a spoon to (gently!) remove the metal wick tab at the
        bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the wax is out, wash the jar thoroughly with hot, soapy water to
        remove any remaining oil or residue. Dry it completely.
      </p>
