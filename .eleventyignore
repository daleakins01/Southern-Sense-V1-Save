This file tells Eleventy which files/folders to NOT process as pages.

CRITICAL FIX (1.1)

Ignore the _includes folder. Without this, Eleventy tries to

build "header.html" and "footer.html" as standalone pages,

which crashes the entire build.

_includes/

Ignore the CSS files. We handle these with "passthrough copy"

in the .eleventy.js config file.
