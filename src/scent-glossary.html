        The Scent Families
      </h2>
      <p>
        Most fragrances can be grouped into "families." These are broad
        categories that share similar characteristics. At Southern Sense, our
        scents primarily fall into these families:

            Bright, airy, and uplifting. Think of fresh laundry, sea breezes,
            or crisp morning air. These scents are often based on citrus,
            green herbs, and light florals.

            The scent of blooming gardens. This family ranges from light and
            delicate (like jasmine) to rich and heady (like rose or tuberose).

            Playful, sweet, and often juicy. These scents are built around

            with spices for extra warmth.

        Understanding Scent Notes
      </h2>
      <p>
        A fragrance is a blend of different ingredients, called "notes."
        These notes unfold over time in three stages, creating the full
        experience of the scent.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Top Notes:</strong> This is your first impression. They are
          the lightest notes and fade the fastest. Common top notes include
          citrus (lemon, bergamot) and light herbs (mint, basil).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Middle Notes (or "Heart Notes"):</strong> These notes emerge
          as the top notes fade. They form the "heart" of the fragrance and
          are usually fuller and more rounded. Common middle notes include
          florals (rose, jasmine) and spices (cinnamon, clove).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Base Notes:</strong> These are the deep, rich notes that
          anchor the scent and last the longest. They provide the final,
          lasting impression. Common base notes include woods (sandalwood,
          cedar), vanilla, musk, and amber.
        </li>
      </ul>

          Scent Throw

        <dd class="pl-4">
          This refers to how well a candle's fragrance fills a room. A "strong
          throw" will fill a large space, while a "subtle throw" is better for
          a small room.

          Wax Melt

        <dd class="pl-4">
          A wickless piece of scented wax that is gently heated in a wax
          warmer to release its fragrance. A great flame-free alternative to
