This file tells Eleventy to ignore specific files or directories.

Ignore the node_modules directory

node_modules/

Ignore the output directory to prevent recursion

_site/

--- CRITICAL FIX ---

Ignore the "ghost" header and footer files that exist

in the root of /src. These are NOT pages and are

crashing the build. The real files are in /src/_includes/

src/header.html
src/footer.html
